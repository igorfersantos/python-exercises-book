### Python Exercises, Gently Explained

This is a repo containing my answers to the exercises asked throughout the book [Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/index.html).

It is a amazing book to grasp python features, how they work and how to use them along with some best practices and tips around it. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you somehow found this repo and you are learning python, I recommend that you stick with [Python's Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) or the same author books [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) first before trying it, as you will need to know python's basic syntax and functionalities to have a better reading of this book. I also recommend checking out others [Al Sweigart's books](https://inventwithpython.com/) after this one, as they are **free to read online**.
